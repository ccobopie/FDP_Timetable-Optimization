# Timetable Optimization

A web application that helps students organize their schedules automatically by optimizing tasks, deadlines, and weekly commitments.  
The system dynamically rearranges timetables whenever new tasks are added, reducing the mental load of manual planning.

- **Automatic scheduling** using a Backtracking Algorithm.
- **Three types of tasks**:
  - `TASK`: flexible tasks with deadlines and estimated hours.
  - `WEEKLY`: recurring weekly activities (e.g., classes).
  - `MEETING`: fixed events with a specific time.
- **Dynamic calendar** that updates whenever new tasks are created.
- **Canvas LMS integration**: import assignments automatically using the Canvas API.
- **Responsive web interface**: accessible from desktop and mobile.
- **User validation and authentication** with Django.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Backend**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python)
- **Algorithm**: Backtracking for task scheduling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **External APIs**: Canvas LMS API

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1\. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/timetable-optimization.git
cd timetable-optimization
```

### 2\. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3\. Activate the environment (Linux/Mac)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4\. Activate the environment (Windows PowerShell)

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 5\. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6\. Configure the database

Edit `settings.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'timetable_db',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```
### 7\. Environment Configuration
Email Configuration (Django)
This section contains the necessary environment variables to configure email sending through an SMTP server, using Gmail as an example.

Important! You must replace the EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD values with your own credentials.

Instructions:

EMAIL_HOST_USER: Replace 'personal@gmail.com' with your Gmail email address.

EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD: The password you should use here is an app password generated by Google, not your regular account password.

You can create an app password in your Google account's security settings, after enabling two-step verification.

This is essential to ensure your account's security, as it exposes this password only to the application.

Make sure not to upload your real credentials to the repository to avoid security issues.
```python
#email in order to sent
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'personal@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password from google'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
```


### 8\. Run migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 9\. Create a superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 10\. Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
